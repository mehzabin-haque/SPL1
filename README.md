Project Description:
                                                  Text to C++ Converter

Many people who are new to programming don't know how to convert a regular language to C++. For example, if someone wants to print the prime numbers from 1 to 100, he or she will struggle at first. This project will assist that person in better understanding C++ programming. The user will provide instructions in regular language, which will be converted to C++ code by this project. As a result, the user will be able to compare c++ and human languages. 
This project will have the following characteristics:
1.	The user will be able to choose the data type of the variables, the number of variables, and the type of work he or she wants to do. For example, repetitive work, math, or statistics.
2.	It will also display errors if the user enters the command incorrectly.
3.	After you've given all of the correct instructions, the project will display the actual c++ code that corresponds to what you've said in human language.
I believe that my project will assist the user in better understanding C++.
